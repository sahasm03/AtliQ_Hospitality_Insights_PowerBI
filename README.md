# AtliQ Hospitality Insights

The project aims to revolutionize data-driven decision-making within the hospitality industry. By harnessing the power of data analytics and visualization, this project enables hotels, resorts, and hospitality businesses to gain deeper insights into their operations, enhance guest experiences, optimize revenue streams, and drive operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.


## Project Overview

 - Data Preparation and Cleansing: The project employs robust data preparation and cleansing techniques to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and reliability. Through Power BI's data transformation capabilities, raw data is refined, cleaned, and structured for effective analysis.
 - Data Modeling: The project utilizes data modeling techniques to establish relationships between different data sets. By defining measures, dimensions, and hierarchies, the project creates a solid foundation for insightful analysis and reporting.

 - Interactive Dashboards and Reports: The heart of the project lies in its interactive dashboards and reports, which provide stakeholders with real-time visibility into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Occupancy %, Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rate (ADR), Daily Sellable Room Nights(DSRN), Daily Booked Room Nights(DBRN),Daily Utilized Room Nights(DURN), Realisation % and revenue breakdown by service. These visually compelling dashboards empower users to explore data, uncover trends, and make informed decisions.

By leveraging historical data and advanced statistical techniques, the project enables businesses to anticipate future trends, optimize pricing strategies, and proactively address operational challenges.
